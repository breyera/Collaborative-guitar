## The Project

This project was about coalescing all of what we have learned so far in the bootcamp. We were tasked with creating a website that serves a function, using at least 2 APIs and a CSS framework.

We elected to make a website based around philosophy, and the commonly known individuals therein. We used 3 APIs to make this happen:

- [Wikimedia's API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) <!-- (with an atrocious documentation) -->
- [Google's API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)
- [Philosophy Quotes API](https://github.com/KaranDahiya/philosophy-quotes-API)

We also used 2 CSS frameworks to build the final product:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Owl Carousel 2](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/)

Using these tools we were able to make multiple interactive elements, a click-through-able quote carousel, a knowledge testing quiz (using local storage), and a curated list of philosophers, complete with individual profiles.
